# The OWASP Testing Framework

**This framework should not be seen as prescriptive, but as a
flexible approach that can be extended and molded to fit an organizationâ€™s development process and culture.
This section aims to help organizations build a complete strategic testing process, and is not aimed at consultants or
contractors who tend to be engaged in more tactical, specific areas of testing**
## Phase 1 Before Development Begins

### Phase 1.1 Define a SDLC

Before application development starts, an adequate SDLC must be defined where security is inherent at each stage.

### Phase 1.2 Review Policies and Standards

Ensure that there are appropriate policies, standards, and documentation in place. Documentation is extremely
important as it gives development teams guidelines and policies that they can follow.

*If the application is to be developed in Java, it is essential that there is a Java secure coding standard. If the application
is to use cryptography, it is essential that there is a cryptography standard. No policies or standards can cover every
situation that the development team will face. By documenting the common and predictable issues, there will be fewer
decisions that need to be made during the development process.*


### Phase 1.3 Develop Measurement and Metrics Criteria and Ensure Traceability

Before development begins, plan the measurement program. By defining criteria that need to be measured, it provides
visibility into defects in both the process and product. It is essential to define the metrics before development begins, as
there may be a need to modify the process in order to capture the data.

## Phase 2 During Definition and Design

### Phase 2.1 Review Security Requirements

Security requirements define how an application works from a security perspective.Testing in this case means testing the assumptions that are made in the requirements and
testing to see if there are gaps in the requirements definitions.

For example, if there is a security requirement that states that users must be registered before they can get access to
the whitepapers section of a website, does this mean that the user must be registered with the system or should the
user be authenticated? Ensure that requirements are as unambiguous as possible.

When looking for requirements gaps, consider looking at security mechanisms such as:

- User management
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Data confidentiality
- Integrity
- Accountability
- Session management
- Transport security
- Tiered system segregation
- Legislative and standards compliance (including privacy, government, and industry standards)

### Phase 2.2 Review Design and Architecture
Applications should have a documented design and architecture. This documentation can include models, textual
documents, and other similar artifacts. It is essential to test these artifacts to ensure that the design and architecture
enforce the appropriate level of security as defined in the requirements.

### Phase 2.3 Create and Review UML Models

Once the design and architecture is complete, build Unified Modeling Language (UML) models that describe how the
application works. In some cases, these may already be available. Use these models to confirm with the systems
designers an exact understanding of how the application works. If weaknesses are discovered, they should be given to
the system architect for alternative approaches.

## Phase 3 During Development
Theoretically, development is the implementation of a design. However, in the real world, many design decisions are
made during code development. These are often smaller decisions that were either too detailed to be described in the
design, or issues where no policy or standard guidance was offered

### Phase 3.1 Code Walkthrough
The security team should perform a code walkthrough with the developers, and in some cases, the system architects. A
code walkthrough is a high-level look at the code during which the developers can explain the logic and flow of the
implemented code. It allows the code review team to obtain a general understanding of the code, and allows the
developers to explain why certain things were developed the way they were.

The purpose is not to perform a code review, but to understand at a high level the flow, the layout, and the structure of
the code that makes up the application

### Phase 3.2 Code Reviews

Armed with a good understanding of how the code is structured, Start Review

Static code reviews validate the code against a set of checklists, including

- Business requirements for availability, confidentiality, and integrity;
- OWASP Guide or Top 10 Checklists for technical exposures (depending on the depth of the review);
- Specific issues relating to the language or framework in use, such as the Scarlet paper for PHP or [Microsoft Secure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ff648269(v=pandp.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)
Coding checklists for ASP.NET; and
- Any industry-specific requirements, such as Sarbanes-Oxley 404, COPPA, ISO/IEC 27002, APRA, HIPAA, Visa
Merchant guidelines, or other regulatory regimes

## Phase 4 During Deployment

### Phase 4.1 Application Penetration Testing
Having tested the requirements, analyzed the design, and performed code review, it might be assumed that all issues
have been caught. Hopefully this is the case, but penetration testing the application after it has been deployed provides
an additional check to ensure that nothing has been missed

### Phase 4.2 Configuration Management Testing
The application penetration test should include an examination of how the infrastructure was deployed and secured. It
is important to review configuration aspects, no matter how small, to ensure that none are left at a default setting that
may be vulnerable to exploitation.

## Phase 5 During Maintenance and Operations

### Phase 5.1 Conduct Operational Management Reviews
There needs to be a process in place which details how the operational side of both the application and infrastructure
is managed.

### Phase 5.2 Conduct Periodic Health Checks
Monthly or quarterly health checks should be performed on both the application and infrastructure to ensure no new
security risks have been introduced and that the level of security is still intact.

### Phase 5.3 Ensure Change Verification
After every change has been approved and tested in the QA environment and deployed into the production
environment, it is vital that the change is checked to ensure that the level of security has not been affected by the
change. This should be integrated into the change management process.
